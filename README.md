##### *That gum you like is going to come back in style.*

Project no longer on hold - compilation issue resolved.

### Now ported to Uno R4 Minima (again?)

  i/o routines likely at the heart of today's difficulty. ;)

  This one branch, radio-aa (radioactive) is working.

  It's radioactive because of mass deletes of a nuisance branch,
  to help clarify things a bit.

  Can easily be merged for changes with a bit of thought (so as
  not to make mistakes, not to re-engineer a thing - already
  working).

  Main problem was likely using for both ESP32 and Uno R4 without
  a bit more finesse.  i/o incompatibility (but very simple to
  rectify) so it's just an organizational issue not a real coding
  mystery at all.

  My apologies.  Wanted to two birds one stone it a bit too eagerly. ;)

### Very likely: ESP32 stand-in for Uno R4 Wifi on Wokwi

  That's explain why the esp32 version (here) is so complete.

  Expecting: wokwi version continues to work on wokwi using
  the esp32 target; and:

  local version working on real Uno R4 hardware.

  Just a theory. ;)
